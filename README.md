# Application features
1. Authentication and Authorization using JWT.
2. Allows for the interns to create their feedback request
3. Code Leads are able to assign feedback request to themselves.
4. Code Leads are able to give Feedback on each feed back request
5. Integration with Floc App webhooks to send out notification upon creation of
   feedback requests and creation of feedbacks.

# Tech Stack
### Front-End Stack
1. The Front-End is being built in react.js
2. UI frame work being used is mantine


## How to Start App

### Front-End
1. clone repo to computer
2. open folder in IDE/Text Editor
3. type `cd views` in terminal to enter into the Views directory
4. type `npm install` and wait for it to finish. then go to step 5.
5. type `npm run dev` to start app

### Setting Up Database
1. clone repo to your computer
2. open folder in IDE/Text Editor
3. Please set up a SQL database before running step 4 (You can download and use [XAMMP](https://www.apachefriends.org/fr/index.html). 
   as its super easy to setup and use. This is not mandatory as you can use any other tool that can spin up a local database server
   in your development environment.
4. Once you have started XAMPP, open the software, you'll see the below. Click on the "Start" button on both the
   `Apache` and `MySQL` module then click on the Admin button on the `MySQL` module. This should open a browser as seen in step 5.

5. See the image below. You'll need to first click on the "New" button (Its the one with the red outline) to create a local database.
next you'll enter `buildufeedback` in the `Database name` field as seen in the area highlighted green in the screenshot below.
next click `Create` and you can start your backend.

### Back-End
1. Make sure you are in the root directory of the app.
2. type `npm install` and wait for it to finish. then go to step 3.
3. Start the server by running `npm start`


# Setting Up a Local Database Using Docker

## Prerequisites:-
Docker installed on your machine. You can download and install Docker from [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

### Step-by-Step Instructions:-

1. Pull the Database Docker Image
First, pull the Docker image for the database you want to use. For example, to use MySQL:

sh Copy code:-
docker pull mysql:latest

For PostgreSQL, use:
sh Copy code:-
docker pull postgres:latest

2. Run the Docker Container
Run a new container from the pulled image. Replace yourpassword with a secure password of your choice.

For MySQL:
sh Copy code:-
docker run --name local-mysql -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=yourpassword -d -p 3306:3306 mysql:latest

For PostgreSQL:-
sh Copy code:-
docker run --name local-postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=yourpassword -d -p 5432:5432 postgres:latest

3. Verify the Container is Running
Check that your container is running by listing all running containers:-

sh Copy code:-
docker ps

You should see your database container listed.

4. Connect to the Database
You can connect to the database using any database client. For example, you can use MySQL Workbench for MySQL or pgAdmin for PostgreSQL.

Host: localhost
Port: 3306 for MySQL, 5432 for PostgreSQL
Username: root for MySQL, postgres for PostgreSQL
Password: The password you specified in the docker run command

5. Create a Database
Once connected, create a new database for your project.

### After setting up to run the database:-
docker-compose up -d

# Setting Up Redis Stack with Docker

## 1. Install Docker
Make sure you have Docker installed on your operating system. You can download and install Docker from the [official Docker website](https://www.docker.com/).

---

## 2. Pull the Redis Image
Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command to pull the Redis Docker image:

```bash
docker pull redis/redis-stack-server:latest
```

This will download the latest Redis image from Docker Hub.

---

## 3. Run the Redis Stack Container
Once the image is downloaded, run the following command to start a Redis container:

```bash
docker run -d --name redis-stack-server -p 6379:6379 redis/redis-stack-server:latest
```

- **`-d`**: Runs the container in detached mode (in the background).
- **`--name redis-stack-server`**: Assigns a name to the container.
- **`-p 6379:6379`**: Maps port `6379` of the container to port `6379` on your host machine. Replace `6379:6379` with `MY_PORT:6379` if you want to use a different port.

If the image hasnâ€™t been downloaded yet, this command will download the image and start the container all at once.

---

## 4. Verify the Installation
Check if the Redis container is running by executing:

```bash
docker ps
```

If the container is running, it will be listed along with other information.

---

## 5. Connect to the Redis Server
You can connect to the Redis server using the specified Redis port (`6379` by default, or your custom port if you mapped a different one).


## Conclusion
Using Docker provides a flexible and easy way to set up a local database for development. By following the steps above, you can quickly get a MySQL or PostgreSQL database up and running.
